# GameHub

GameHub is a responsive web application built with React, TypeScript, and Chakra UI. It provides users with information about video games, such as genres and game details, using the [RAWG API](https://www.rawg.io). The app is deployed on Vercel and includes a live demo for easy access!

## Tech Stack

- Frontend:
    - [React](https://react.dev/)
    - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
    - [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/)
    - [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

- API
    - [RAWG API](https://www.rawg.io)

- HTTP Client
    - [Axios](https://www.axios.com/) for making API requests.

- Deployment:
    - [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for deployment.

## Installation and Setup

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
`
https://github.com/ghezel1995/game-hub.git
`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
` cd game-hub `
3. Install the dependencies:
` npm install `
4. Set up your API key from RAWG API. The api-client.ts file already handles the API key and base URL:

```js
    // src/services/api-client.ts
    import axios from 'axios';

    export default axios.create({
        baseURL: 'https://api.rawg.io/api',
        params: {
            key: 'your-api-key-here', // Replace with your actual API key
        },
    });

```

 5. Start the development server:

` npm start ` and ` http://localhost:3000 `

or if you use vite: 

` npm run dev ` and `http://localhost:5173`

## API Integration

GameHub interacts with the RAWG API to retrieve data about video games, including genres, platforms, and individual game details. Four custom hooks are used to handle dynamic data fetching, making the app scalable and efficient.

## Custom Hooks

1. useData<T>():
  This generic hook is the core data-fetching function. It takes an endpoint, optional request configurations, and dependencies to dynamically fetch data from the API.

  - __Parameters:__

    - `endpoint`: API endpoint for the resource.

    - `requestConfig`: Optional Axios configuration object.

    - `deps`: Dependency array for `useEffect` to trigger refetching.
- Example Usage:

```js
useData<Game>('/games', { params: { genres: genreId } }, [genreId]);
```

2. __useGames():__

This hook is responsible for fetching game data based on the user's query. It takes in a GameQuery object (which includes filters like genre, platform, sort order, and search text) and returns a list of games that match the criteria.

- GameQuery includes:
    - `genre`: Selected genre (e.g., RPG, Action).
    - `platform`: Selected platform (e.g., PC, PlayStation).
    - `sortOrder`: How to sort the games (e.g., by popularity or rating).
    - `searchText`: Text entered by the user for searching games.

- Example Usage:

```js
    useGames({
        genre: selectedGenre,
        platform: selectedPlatform,
        sortOrder: 'popularity',
        searchText: 'Elden Ring',
    });
``` 

3. __useGenres():__

This hook provides a list of game genres. For simplicity and efficiency, it pulls the data from a static local file (data/genres.ts) rather than making a dynamic API request.

- Example Usage:

```js
    const { data: genres, isLoading, error } = useGenres();
```

4. __usePlatforms():__

This hook fetches the list of game platforms (e.g., PlayStation, Xbox, PC) using the RAWG API. It leverages the useData hook to fetch platforms dynamically.

- Example Usage:

```js
    const { data: platforms, isLoading, error } = usePlatforms();
```

These custom hooks make data fetching modular, reusable, and easy to manage across the application, ensuring the app remains performant and maintainable.
